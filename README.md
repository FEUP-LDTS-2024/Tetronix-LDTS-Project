## Tetronix

This project is inspired in the game Tetris. The goal of this game to complete the lines by moving differently shaped pieces which are descending onto the field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points and the game ends when the uncleared lines reach the top of the playing field. The longer the player can delay this outcome, the higher their score will be.
